    <!--
    here first we insert the image then link it to map tag
    area as polygan so four x,y coords
    then coordinates of rajasthan we take by:
    open the india map in paint then on that state corners we keep mouse 
    below left corner it shows x,y coords
    paste those
    give the href link
    
    we can give circle also by taking 
    random point on MP as x,y and radius as 50
    if we give more then it goes to other state also 
    so it covers that area
