<!-- POLYMORPHISM
create class called shape and inside it a method shape
another class square which inherits the class shape
Square is child class of Shape but both have same method draw()

if the method is in child class it executes statement only which is in child class 
if the method is not in child class then only it executes the statement in parent class  -->
